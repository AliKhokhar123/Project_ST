It is an auction website for Artists. where artists can publish there art for the auction. This website doesn't have a database or doesn't work on any backend. Rather it is functionaling purely with JavaScript. The data is being fethced from the array and the array is being updated. We select a specific artist and then all the content is shown of that particular artis with the help of JS. that artist can see live auction and can add a new art for the auction.
